HFMD was typically described as about 3-7 days but empirical evidence is lacking.', 'In addition, we discuss: the disease caused by the particular microbe; the mode of transmission; the incubation time needed within the host prior to the onset of disease; and the duration of illness.', 'For monitored individuals, we identified unique durations of active monitoring that minimize expected costs

seem to have been largely underestimated, and they are currently being investigated for their potential medical relevance.', 'While each incident is unique, the number and type of response activities

required to respond to future acute events.', \"The time when the insult/triggering event occurs in Legg-Calvé-Perthes' (LCPD) is unknown.\"]\n\nQuestion: Prevalence of asymptomatic shedding and transmission (e.g., particularly children).\nAnswers: ['The prevalence of FCV in the general cat population is high, particularly in multi-cat households, largely because many clinically recovered cats remain persistently infected carriers.', 'Respiratory viruses (predominantly rhinovirus) were detected by real-time RT-PCR in 9% of samples obtained from symptom-free SCT recipients at predetermined times by real-time RT-PCR and by viral culture in 1% (P < .0001), indicating that asymptomatic shedding of respiratory viruses also occurs.', 'BACKGROUND: The prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) affecting children and adolescents has increased dramatically in recent years.', 'Herd prevalence was found to be 91.7% (11/12 herds) for Giardia and 58.3% (7/12 herds) for Cryptosporidium.', 'The incidence of foodborne diseases has been underreported and underestimated, and the asymptomatic presentation of some of the illnesses, worldwide heterogeneities in reporting, and the alternative transmission routes of certain pathogens are among the factors that contribute to this.', 'Herd prevalence was found to be 91.7% (11/12 herds) for Giardia and 58.3% (7/12 herds) for Cryptosporidium.', 'The prevalence of bronchiectasis is age-related and there is some geographical variation in incidence, prevalence and clinical features.', '28 Increased risk for infections in child-care settings is of public health significance because of potential transmission to adult contacts and dissemination into the community.', 'The prevalence of HCoV or individual species was not significantly higher among hospitalized children than controls.', 'The presence of a high-level shedder on a farm was found to be associated with a high proportion of low-level shedding, consistent with the possibility of a higher level of transmission.']\n\nQuestion: Seasonality of transmission.\nAnswers: ['The structure of school terms is well known to influence seasonality of transmission rates of childhood infectious diseases in industrialized countries.', 'AbstractHeterogeneity in disease transmission is widespread and, when not accounted for, can produce unpredictable outbreaks of infectious disease.', 'In addition, cohort entry causes an annual decline in the effective transmission that is evident in observed time series, but not in models without the cohort effect.', 'An additional component that affects disease spread is the seasonality in transmission.', 'Seasonality in the numbers of conceptions in different months can also induce a mechanical correlation between preterm birth and month of birth.', 'We find a weak signal of transmission, defined by the inferred sharing of genotypes, across many organisms that, in aggregate, reveals strong transmission patterns, most notably within households and between spouses.', 'Despite these efforts, there has been a sharp rise in the number of confirmed cases within the identified affected areas, and due to a number of challenges unique to DRC, there has been an expansion in the geographical extent of transmission.', 'Abstract We investigate the effects of delaying the time to recovery (delayed recovery) and of nonuniform transmission on the propagation of diseases on structured populations.', 'In particular, seasonal variations in demographic processes may considerably affect the persistence of a pathogen in these populations.', 'Seasonality is a complex force in nature that affects multiple processes in wild animal populations.']\n\nQuestion: Physical science of the coronavirus (e.g., charge distribution, adhesion to hydrophilic/phobic surfaces, environmental survival to inform decontamination efforts for affected areas and provide information about viral shedding).\nAnswers: ['Strategies for genetic engineering of baculoviruses have been developed to meet the requirements of new application areas.', 'Such approaches would also prove useful in the more specific evaluation of how pDCss mediate tolerance and autoimmunity.', 'Further larger-scale studies are needed to better assess the possible role of environmental respiratory pathogens in respiratory infections in Hajj pilgrims.', 'Our analysis of the full genome sequence of a recombinant PDCoV and its virulence in suckling piglets might provide new insights into the pathogenesis of PDCoV and facilitate further investigation of this newly emerged pathogen.', 'This review focuses on the implications of SARS for healthcare workers and patients on critical care units.', 'This surprising finding, together with the fact that M protein molecules are also located in the virion envelope, indicates that a reconsideration of the assembly and maturation of coronaviruses, as well as a study of potential M-protein subclasses, is needed.', 'This review highlights some of the major features of alphaviruses that have been investigated during recent years.', 'The potential of scFvs to provide prevention against PEDV infections in piglets was further investigated.', 'Areas covered: In this review, we provide an overview of the progress in the development of therapeutic strategies for MERS.', 'Essential features of the natural history of disease are poorly understood.']\n\nQuestion: Persistence and stability on a multitude of substrates and sources (e.g., nasal discharge, sputum, urine, fecal matter, blood).\nAnswers: ['Summary: Protein microarrays have proved to be reliable research tools in screening for a multitude of parameters with only a minimal quantity of sample and have enormous potential in applications for diagnostic and personalized medicine.', 'Conventional and alternative methods by which persistence can be studied are described, and the natural factors influencing virus persistence outside the host organism are discussed.', 'Available data concerning virus persistence in water, soil, on surfaces and in food products are reviewed.', 'The agent’s environmental stability, methods suitable for inactivation and disinfection, and potential antiviral compounds have been studied, and development of vaccines and immunotherapeutics is ongoing.', 'Viral persistence can also be established in vitro in various human, animal, arachnid and insect cell lines in culture.', 'The environmental survival and persistence of nucleic acid associated with these viral agents may be important for both the detection as well as the occurrence of related diseases.', 'Although the survival of PEDV under various pHs and temperatures has been studied, virus stability on different fomite surfaces under varying temperature conditions has not been explored.', 'These data illustrate that MHV persistence in vitro provides a model to identify critical sites of virus-host interaction at the cellular level which are altered during the evolution of host cell resistance to viral infection and the coevolution of virus virulence.', 'Radiolabeling efficiency, in vitro stability and bacterial binding of 99mTc-Levofloxacin and 99mTc-micelles were compared.', 'In this work, we developed a prototype open-architecture, automated nucleic acid workstation that includes a mechanical homogenization and lysis function integrated with heating and TruTip purification; optimized an extraction protocol for raw sputum; and evaluated system performance on primary clinical specimens.']\n\nQuestion: Persistence of virus on surfaces of different materials (e,g., copper, stainless steel, plastic).\nAnswers: ['Persistence was slightly prolonged on ceramic surfaces.', 'We have shown previously that noroviruses are destroyed on copper alloy surfaces.', 'Consequently, copper alloy surfaces could be employed in communal areas and at any mass gatherings to help reduce transmission of respiratory viruses from contaminated surfaces and protect the public health.', 'Exposure to copper destroyed the viral genomes and irreversibly affected virus morphology, including disintegration of envelope and dispersal of surface spikes.', 'Background In the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak, finding viral nucleic acids on hospital surfaces suggested surfaces could play a role in spread in health care environments.', 'Available data concerning virus persistence in water, soil, on surfaces and in food products are reviewed.', 'Available data concerning virus persistence in water, soil, on surfaces and in food products are reviewed.', 'Although the survival of PEDV under various pHs and temperatures has been studied, virus stability on different fomite surfaces under varying temperature conditions has not been explored.', 'Background In the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak, finding viral nucleic acids on hospital surfaces suggested surfaces could play a role in spread in health care environments.', 'Surface disinfection may interrupt transmission, but few data exist on the effectiveness of health care germicides against coronaviruses on surfaces.']\n\nQuestion: Natural history of the virus and shedding of it from an infected person\nAnswers: ['Essential features of the natural history of disease are poorly understood.', 'Although the ability to predict influenza pandemics remains no better than it was a century ago, numerous scientific advances provide an important head start in limiting severe disease and death from both current and future influenza viruses: identification and substantial characterization of the natural history and pathogenesis of the 1918 causative virus itself, as well as hundreds of its viral descendants; development of moderately effective vaccines; improved diagnosis and treatment of influenza-associated pneumonia; and effective prevention and control measures.', 'Background: The natural history and consequences of severe H1N1 influenza infection among cancer patients are not yet fully characterized.', 'BACKGROUND: Volunteer challenge studies have provided detailed data on viral shedding from the respiratory

on emerging infectious diseases, held in Paris on March 22nd, 2016, with seven priority proposals that can be outlined as follows: encourage research on the prediction, screening and early detection of new risks of infection; develop research and surveillance concerning transmission of pathogens between animals and humans, with their reinforcement in particular in intertropical areas (“hot-spots”) via public support; pursue aid development and support in these areas of prevention and training for local health personnel, and foster risk awareness in the population; ensure adapted patient care in order to promote adherence to treatment and to epidemic propagation reduction measures; develop greater awareness and better education among politicians and healthcare providers, in order to ensure more adapted response to new types of crises; modify the logic of governance, drawing from all available modes of communication and incorporating new information-sharing tools; develop economic research on the fight against emerging infectious diseases, taking into account specific driving factors in order to create a balance between preventive and curative approaches.', 'Exploiting synergies between different methods best utilizes the information available and is at the center of recent developments.', 'The public-private partnerships in the networks have led to an upgrade in
